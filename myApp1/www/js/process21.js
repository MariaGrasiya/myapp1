<center><h1>Parable of the Tiny Frog</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>Once upon a time there was a bunch of tiny frogs..Who arraged a climbing competition. The goal was to teach the top of a very high tower.

A big crowd had gathered around the tower to see the race and cheer on the contestant. The race began..

honestly: No one in the crowd really believed that the tiny frogs would reach the top of the tower. you heard statements such as:"Oh, way too difficult!".They wil never make it to the top." Not a cance that they will succeed." the tower is too high!".

The tiny frigs began collapsing . One by one ..Except for those, who kept a fresh tempo and kept climbing higher and higher.

The crowd continue to yell,"It is too difficult!" No one will make it !.More tiny frogs got tired and gave up..

But one continued higher and higher and higher..This one wouldn't give up!

At the end everyone else had given up climbing the tower. Except for the one iny frog who, after a big effort, was the only one who reached the top!

All the other tiny frogs naturally wanted to know how this one managed to do it. A contestant asked the tiny frog how he had found the strength to succeed and reach the goal!

It turned out..the winner is a deaf. The wisdom of this story is: Never listen to other's people tendencies to be negative or pessimistic.. They take your most wonderful dreams and wishes away from you if you let them-the ones you have in you heart!</p>
