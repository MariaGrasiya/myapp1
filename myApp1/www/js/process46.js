<center><h1>The Parable of the Vine and the Branches</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>Im am the true vine and my father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away, and every branch that does bear a fruit he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you. Abide in me, and I in you.</p>
<p>
As the branch cannot bear a fruit by itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you,unless oyu can abide in me and I in him,he it is that bears the much fruit,for apart from me you can do nothing.</p>
<p>
If anyone does not abide in me he is thrown away like a branch and withers; and the branches are gathered ,thrown into the fire, and burned. If you abide in me , and my words abide on you.ask whatever you wish, and it will done for you.</p>
<p>
But this is my father is glorified, that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the father has loved me. If you keep my commandents, you will abide in my love, just I have kept my father's commandments and abide in his love</p>
<p>
These thing i have spoke to you, that my joy maybe in you, and that your joy maybe full.This is my commandments.That you love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends . You are my friends if you do what I command you</p>
<p>
 No longer di I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master doing : but I have called you friends ,for all that I have heard from my father I have made known to you.</p>
 <p>
 You did not choose me . but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your fruit should abide,so that whatever you ask the father  in my name ,he may give it to you. These things I command you,so that you will love one another</p>
