And the rest seized his servants ,treated them spitefully,and killed them. But when the king heard about it,he was furious.And he sent out armies,destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.Then he said to his servans."The wedding is ready, But thse who were invited were not worthy. Therefore go to into the highways, and as many as you find,Invite to the wedding." So those servants went out into the highways , and gathered together all whom they found,both bad and good.
