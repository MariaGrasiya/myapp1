<font size="14"><p>"Or imagine a woman has ten coins and loses one. Won't she light a lamp and scour the house, looking in every nook and cranny until she finds it? And when she finds it you can be sure she'll call her friends and neighbors:" Celebrate with me! I found my lost coin! ",Count on it- that's the kind of party God's Angels throw every time one lost soul to God".</p>
