<center><h1>Parable of the Strong Man</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>It goes something like this :" how can one enter a strong man's house and plunder his property,Without first tying up the strong man. Then indeed the house can be plundered" Sounds easy enough , right Let's dig in".</p>
<p>
Right before Jesus lays this parable on us, the pharisees are going at him pretty hard. They see Jesus casting out demons and they tell the crowds that" It is only Beelzebul,the ruler of the demons,the ruler of the demons,that this fellow casts out thedemons. In other words, Jesus is clearly in league with the devil.</p>
<p>
For God things are possible. Jesus can defeat satan,the strong man ,because he's got devine backing. And also because hes just yhat good </p>
