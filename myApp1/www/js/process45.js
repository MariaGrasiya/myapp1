<center><h1>The Parable of the Rich Young Ruler</h1></center>
<font size="14"><p>The rich young man  and behold, a man came up ti him,saying,"Teacher,what good deed must I do to have eternal life?" And he said to him,"Why do you asked me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, Keep the commandments," He said to him" Which one"? and Jesus said," You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, Honor your father and mother, and you shall love your beighbor as yourself". The yung man said to him" If you would be perfect go,sell what you posses and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come,follow me." When the young man heared this he went away sorrowful,for he had great possessions. And Jesus said to his disciples," Truly, I say to you. Only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, It is easier for a xamel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God."When the disciples heard this, They were greatly astonished,saying," Who then can be saved?" But Jesus looked at them and said," With man this is impossible,but with God all things are possible"</p>
