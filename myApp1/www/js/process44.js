<font size="14"><p>It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge,each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake.Therefore stay awake-for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening,or at midnight, or when the rooster crows, or in the morning-lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake.</p>
